**Getting Started (Prerequisites):**

1. **Flutter Environment Setup:**
   - **Official Documentation:** [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
   - **Installation Guide:** Follow the comprehensive instructions to set up Flutter on your preferred operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Basic Skills:** Possessing a solid understanding of Flutter and Dart development will significantly aid your contribution.

**Contributing to Hashi:**

I encourage you to partake in the evolution of Hashi! Here's how you can join the adventure:

1. **Forking the Repository:**
   - **GitHub Interface:** Visit the Hashi repository on GitHub ([https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/Hashi) and click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
   - **Command Line:** Alternatively, use the `git` command: ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aluffyy/Hashi.git``` 

2. **Cloning Your Fork:**
   - Access your terminal or command prompt.
   - **Command:** Navigate to your desired local directory and use ```git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Hashi.git``` to clone your forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Creating a Branch:**
   - **Purpose:** Branches serve to isolate your changes from the main development branch (master).
   - **Command:** Use ```git checkout -b <your_branch_name>``` to create a new branch from the `master` branch. Replace `<your_branch_name>` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add_group_chats`).

4. **Making Your Magic Happen:**
   - Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA) and navigate to the cloned Hashi project directory.
   - Implement your code changes and modifications.
   - **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test your changes to ensure they don't introduce any regressions.

5. **Committing Your Work:**
   - **Git Command:** Use `git add <changed_files>` to stage your changes for committing. You can specify specific files or use `git add .` for all modified files. 
   - **Commit Message:** Provide a clear and concise message describing your changes using ```git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"```.

6. **Pushing to Your Fork:**
   - **Command:** Share your committed changes with the remote repository (your forked copy on GitHub) using ```git push origin <your_branch_name>```.

7. **Pull Request Power:**
   - Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "Pull requests" and then "New pull request."
   - Select your branch containing your changes (the one you pushed in step 6).
   - Compare your branch with the upstream repository's `master` branch.
   - Provide a detailed pull request description explaining your modifications and their value to the project.
   - Submit your pull request for review by the Hashi developers.
